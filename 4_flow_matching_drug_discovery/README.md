`flow_matching.ipynb`

Welcome to the flow matching notebook, accompanying Joey Bose's talk! Here, we shall present a quick but thorough tour of what flow matching is and how it can be (rather) easily ported to specific geometries (Riemannian manifolds). In the first part, we shall see how to perform usual flow matching, with various samplers, and various couplings allowing for faster training. In the second part, we shall show how to port all of this to the mentioned geometries.


`drug_discovery.ipynb`
In this part of tutorial we will focus on applying our knowledge to generate cell state trajectories in single-cell data 🧬🧫 These trajectories are cool because they reveal tissue mechanics and disease progression, making them crucial for drug discovery and medical research!🏥

Single-cell technology has changed the way we study biology. Instead of averaging signals from millions of cells, we can now measure thousands of cells one by one.
